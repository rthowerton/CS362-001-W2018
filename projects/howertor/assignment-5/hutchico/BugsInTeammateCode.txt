1. In line 113 of Appt.java, isValid() method, removed -1 from int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth);
   This causes isValid to reference DaysInMonth incorrectly, unable to reach January and going out of bounds with a value of 12.

2. In line 282 of Appt.java, represntationApp() method, changed if(printableHour > 11) to if(printableHour < 11).
   This causes represntationApp to subtract 12 from the hour if the time is less than 11, leaving all numbers greater than 11 as is (essentially printing all times incorrectly).

3. In line 53 of TimeTable.java, getApptRange() method, changed for (int i = 0; i < appts.size(); i++) to for (int i = 1; i < appts.size(); i++).
   This causes getApptRange to ignore the first appointment in the list of appointments whenever called.
